# OCaml Code of Conduct

This repository contains documents related to the Code of Conduct.

### Code of Conduct text

Here's the Code of conduct [text](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Adopting this Code of Conduct

OCaml open source project maintainers and moderators of OCaml community spaces are welcome,
and highly encouraged to adopt this Code of Conduct. To do so, you can use the
following format.

- Create a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` in your repository. Add the text in
  [CODE_OF_CONDUCT_TEMPLATE](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT_TEMPLATE.md), and fill in your
  contact details.
- Make a pull request to add your project to the [list of adopters](./list-of-adopters.md).
- You can also include the Code of Conduct team's contact details for reporting
  Code of Conduct violations. If you wish to do so, we request you to check with
  us first, either by mentioning you'd like to add the team's contact details for
  your project in your pull request, or by writing to
  [coc-help@ocaml.org](mailto:coc-help@ocaml.org).

We recommend adding a link to the Code of Conduct instead of adding the text to your
project, to stay on top of the text as it evolves.

### Feedback

Feedback on the Code of Conduct is appreciated. Feel free to use the
issue tracker for any suggestions and questions.
